# Skill: Validate Implementation Against Spec

**Trigger:** User says "validate spec", "check spec", or "/spec-validate"

## Purpose

Validate that an implementation meets all success criteria and quality standards from the spec.

## Instructions

Follow the same instructions as the Cursor command in `.cursor/commands/spec-validate.md`

## Quick Process

1. Read spec success criteria
2. Check each criterion
3. Run all tests
4. Verify code quality (linting, types, patterns)
5. Generate validation report

## Success

Comprehensive report showing pass/fail for all criteria.

## Next Step

If passing: "Ready for code review"
If failing: "Fix these issues and re-validate"
