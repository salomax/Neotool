# Skill: Implement Feature from Spec

**Trigger:** User says "implement spec", "implement [feature-slug]", or "/spec-implement"

## Purpose

Implement a complete feature from a spec file by exploring the codebase and learning patterns.

## Core Principle

**Learn HOW from code, not from documentation.**

## Instructions

Follow the same instructions as the Cursor command in `.cursor/commands/spec-implement.md`

## Quick Process

1. Read spec from `spec/features/[feature-slug].md`
2. Explore integration points (code paths in spec)
3. Learn patterns from existing code
4. Implement backend + frontend + tests
5. Validate against success criteria

## Success

Feature is fully implemented following codebase patterns, all success criteria met.

## Next Step

Tell user: "To validate, say: validate spec [feature-slug]"
