# Network Policy: PostgreSQL - Only PgBouncer can connect
# 
# This policy ensures that only PgBouncer can connect to PostgreSQL.
# All other pods (including applications) must connect through PgBouncer.
#
# Security benefit: Even if an application pod is compromised, it cannot
# directly access the database, only through the connection pooler.
